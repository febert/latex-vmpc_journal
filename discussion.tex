\section{Discussion}
Generalization and multi-task performance is arguably one of the biggest challenges in robotic manipulation today. While deep learning has relieved us from much of the problem-specific engineering, most of the works either require extensive amounts of labeled data or in the case of deep reinforcement learning, focus on the mastery of single tasks while relying on human-provided reward signals. 

From the experiments with visual MPC, especially the qualitative examples and the multi-task benchmark, we can conclude that visual MPC \emph{generalizes} to a wide range of tasks it has never seen during training. Most of the generalization performance is likely a result of large-scale self-supervised learning, which allows to acquire a rich dynamics model of the environment.
