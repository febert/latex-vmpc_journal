\section{Discussion}


\todo{can cut from here:}
\textbf{Gradient-free vs. gradient based trajectory optimization} Prior work has also proposed to plan through learned models via differentiation, though not with visual inputs~\cite{deep_mpc}. This can have the disadvantage of getting stuck in local minima. Also with gradient-based methods it is harder to ensure that the actions are within the distribution of actions sampled during data collection. This is crucial to ensure that the model can make predictions based on a sufficient number of supporting data-points.


Instead using a model that predicts in pixel space, one could think of using a model making predictions in latent space. One potential advantage of latent space representations could be to handle \emph{partially observed} settings, for example tasks where an object is occluded for extended periods of time.
%%SL.10.16: I would suggest just cutting this section. It's completely out of place and has nothing to do with what's in the paper. You could perhaps condense it into 2-3 sentences in the Discussion and Future Work Section

%%SL.10.16: But more importantly, you *really* need to discuss the conclusions to be drawn from the experiments!
