\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experiment_setup}
To train both our video-prediction and registration models, we collected 20,000 trajectories of pushing motions and 15,000 trajectories with gripper control, where the robot randomly picks and moves objects using the grasping reflex described in section \ref{sec:system}. The data collection process is fully autonomous, requiring human intervention only to change out the objects in front of the robot. The action space consisted of relative movements of the end-effector in cartesian space along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, and for some parts of the dataset we also added azimuthal rotations of the gripper and a grasping action.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Experiments with multiple-objects rearrangement with occlusion}

 \autoref{fig:goingaroundocclusion} \todo{change this}shows an example of the SNA model successfully predicting the position of the obstacle through an occlusion and finding a trajectory that avoids the obstacle.

	\caption{Left: Task setup with green dot marking the obstacle. Right, first row: the predicted frames generated by SNA. Second row: the probability distribution of the designated pixel on the \textit{moving} object (brown stuffed animal). Note that part of the distribution shifts down and left, which is the indicated goal. Third row: the probability distribution of the designated pixel on the obstacle-object (blue power drill). Although the distribution increases in entropy during the occlusion (in the middle), it then recovers and remains on its original position.

\section{Simulated Experiments}
%\todo{shorten if necessary}

In order to provide a more controlled comparison, we also set up a realistic simulation environment using MuJoCo \cite{todorov2012mujoco}, which includes a robotic manipulator controlled via Cartesian position control, similar to our real world setup, pushing randomly-generated L-shaped objects with random colors (see details in supplementary materials). 
We trained the same video prediction model in this environment, and set up 50 evaluation tasks where blocks must be pushed to target locations with maximum episode lengths of 120 steps. 
We  compare our proposed registration-based method, ``predictor propagation,'' and ground-truth registration obtained from the simulator, which provides an oracle upper bound on registration performance. \autoref{fig:sim_bench} shows the results of this simulated evaluation, where the x-axis shows different distance thresholds, and the y-axis shows the fraction of evaluation scenarios where each method pushed the object within that threshold. We can see that, for thresholds around 0.1, our method drastically outperforms predictor propagation (i.e., prior work~\cite{sna}), and has a relatively modest gap in performance against ground-truth tracking. This indicates that our registration method is highly effective in guiding visual MPC, despite being entirely self-supervised.
