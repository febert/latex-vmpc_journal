\section{Discussion}


\todo{can cut from here:}

%%SL.10.16: I would suggest just cutting this section. It's completely out of place and has nothing to do with what's in the paper. You could perhaps condense it into 2-3 sentences in the Discussion and Future Work Section

%%SL.10.16: But more importantly, you *really* need to discuss the conclusions to be drawn from the experiments!
